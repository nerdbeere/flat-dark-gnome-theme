## Installation

### Requirements

You need to enable the [User Themes](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/19/user-themes/) GNOME Shell Extension.

Follow the link and flick the switch to "on" to enable it.

**If you want to install it manually:**

- Download and uncompress the zip file.
- Either move `flat-dark` to your `.themes` directory in your home directory;
  or create a symbolic link to the folder (ctrl-shift drag does this in Nautilus).
  If the directory `.themes` does not exist create it.
- Select "Flat Dark" as shell theme in gnomes Tweak Tool.

**If you prefer to use the terminal:**

```
mkdir ~/available-themes
mkdir ~/.themes
cd ~/available-themes
git clone https://github.com/nerdbeere/flat-dark-gnome-theme
ln -s ~/available-themes/flat-dark-gnome-theme/flat-dark ~/.themes/flat-dark
```
